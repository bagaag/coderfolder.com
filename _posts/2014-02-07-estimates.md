title: "Why Estimates Are Important"

I've worked at agencies for my entire career. Agencies are unique among software companies in their singular obsession with time. Time is their bread and butter, so they tend to pay a lot of attention to how long things take. You can go so far as to say that a service business is as profitable as their ability to accurately estimate their work. (Value pricing is for another post.)

As a programmer, estimating your work is good practice, even if your day-to-day doesn't requrie it. There are a few reasons why:

* Time is important everywhere, even if not at the hour level. When your manager asks how long something will take you, being off by a day or week could have a substantial impact. Even if you work for yourself, understanding how long something will take will help you make important decisions about what to work on and when. 
* If I may be somewhat recurisive, estimating is learned by doing. There's no other way to do it. The more estimating you do, the better your estimates will be.
* Estimating and tracking your time will help you become a better programmer by forcing you to think broadly about efficiency. This simple act can lead to valuable insights into how you work.

Unfortunately, most developers are terrible at estimating. Developers tend to be an optimistic bunch, thinking things are much easier than they really are and glossing over important details when considering the effort of a specific task. While this is a loveable trait, it can be infuriating to those trying to plan around these optimistic estimates.

My advice is this:

* Whether you have to or not, estimate every programming task before you start. 
* Track your time with religious fervor. There are countless tools to help you do this as painlessly as possible. Despite them all, I still use a text file and a macro to insert timestamps. (I'll post my timesheet text file processing script here at some point).
* When you're done, compare the actual vs. estimate. If they're substantially different, consider what you can learn from the exercise. 
Record your findings. 
* Recognize that most of estimating is properly understanding the requirements, or at least making intelligent (and documented) assumptions about them. Consider your client before assuming what they want is the simplest possible solution.

Over time (and it does take a fair amount of time, so be patient), you'll get really good at estimating. Along the way, look for ways to abstract the effort of doing similar types of things. The more you do that, the less ultra-specific requirements and planning you'll need to come up with mostly accurate estimates. Keep it up and before you know it, you'll be an estimating master.
