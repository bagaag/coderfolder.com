This is a browser-based crossword puzzle game implemented completely in JavaScript. I wrote this sometime last summer. It reads in the puzzle data as json from a .js file. It supports multiple puzzles on the page and can be directed at any HTML container. To be honest, I don't recall where the sample puzzle data came from, but I know its not mine. I've posted it at GitHub under GNU license. Enjoy.
