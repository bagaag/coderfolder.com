Started a new thing tonight. I installed Ubuntu for the first time in years (it's come a long way) and am geeking out with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Fun stuff.

My belated New Year's resolution is to rediscover hobby programming. I say rediscover because it occurred to me that I learned how to use computers and then how to program by doing it for fun. Somewhere along the way it became a job. Still, I programmed side projects nights and weekends for fun. Eventually one of those turned into a business. While running that business, the line between work programming and hobby programming got blurred and eventually disappeared. 

I've since sold that business and now have a job in management. While I love what I do, I do miss programming. That longing resulted in a few misguided attempts at doing another startup or embarking on overly ambitious open source projects. Those also quickly felt like work. I was missing the point. 

Finally, it occurred to me that I should just embrace programming for fun. I can work on whatever strikes my interest on my own time and love every minute of it. It reminds me of a conversation with a friend of mine who is an amazing pianist about why he isn't in the music business. His answer? He loves playing too much to risk it becoming work, and any form of work would by definition confine or limit his playing. 

So maybe I'll keep track of what I work on here. Maybe I won't. We'll see if Jekyll stays fun.
