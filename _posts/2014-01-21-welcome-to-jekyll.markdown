Started a new thing tonight. I installed Ubuntu for the first time in years (it's come a long way) and am geeking out with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Fun stuff.

My belated New Year's resolution is to rediscover hobby programming. I say rediscover because it occurred to me that I learned how to use computers and then how to program by doing it for fun. Somewhere along the way it became a job. Still, I programmed side projects nights and weekends for fun. Eventually one of those turned into a business. While running that business, the line between work programming and hobby programming got blurred and eventually disappeared. 

I've since sold that business and now have a job in management. I don't code at work, but I'm surrounded by coders and get to think about technical stuff. While I love what I do, I do miss programming. That longing resulted in a few misguided attempts at doing another startup or embarking on overly ambitious open source projects. Those also quickly felt like work. I was missing the point. 

Finally, it occurred to me that I should just program for fun. I can work on whatever strikes my interest on my own time and love every minute of it. Duh.

So maybe I'll keep track of what I work on here. Maybe I won't. We'll see if Jekyll stays fun.
