Here are some fun programming ideas I've collected.

* Jekyll-based personal programming knowledgebase (big, needs some planning)
* Notepad++ module in C#
* Extensible site-to-site SSO service
* Word search (false starts, linear/nonlinear)
* Examples of common data structures
* Maze generator (square, circular)
* Generate repeatable random number sets from a seed
* Music generator with pluggable rule sets
* Create a simple game using http://www.lwjgl.org/ or http://jmonkeyengine.org/
* Write a guage control in canvas
* Simple minecraft mod
* Wordpress sandbox site with bootstrap and page builder

Ideas that apply specifically to this site:

* Spruce up this Jekyll site's layout and CSS
* Add Disquss to this site

And here are some I've already done that I'll try and get around to posting about here.

* Browser-based crossword puzzle app in HTML/JS
* A very lightweight persistence library for Java 
* Some simple Java utility classes
