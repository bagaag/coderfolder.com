Here are some fun programming ideas I've collected.

* HTML/JS graph paper
* Jekyll plugin - how about listing the tags for a post and linking them to the tag list page
* Jekyll-based personal programming knowledgebase (big, needs some planning)
* Notepad++ module in C#
* Extensible site-to-site SSO service
* Project management and process for developers
* Word search (false starts, linear/nonlinear)
* Examples of common data structures
* Value pricing
* Maze generator (square, circular)
* Generate repeatable random number sets from a seed
* Music generator with pluggable rule sets
* Create a simple game using http://www.lwjgl.org/ or http://jmonkeyengine.org/
* Write a guage control in canvas
* Simple minecraft mod - how about a Bell block for hanging in church steeples
* Wordpress sandbox site with bootstrap and page builder

Ideas that apply specifically to this site:

* Spruce up this Jekyll site's layout and CSS
* Change to coderfolder

And here are some I've already done that I'll try and get around to posting about here.

* A very lightweight persistence library for Java 
* Time sheet processor
* Some simple Java utility classes
