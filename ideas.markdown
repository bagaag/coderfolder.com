Here are some fun programming ideas I've collected.

* Simple server side script to write and edit Jekyll posts, kick off commits and site builds
* Katas from codewars.com
* A placeholder image server featuring guinea pigs
* Rails project to connect people in a group for 1-1 meetings
* Write an SVG guage control
* A round-trip BDD example
* Notepad++ module in C#
* Extensible site-to-site SSO service
* Project management and process for developers
* Word search (false starts, linear/nonlinear)
* Examples of common data structures
* Value pricing
* Maze generator (square, circular)
* Generate repeatable random number sets from a seed
* Music generator with pluggable rule sets
* Create a simple game using http://www.lwjgl.org/ or http://jmonkeyengine.org/
* Simple minecraft mod - how about a Bell block for hanging in church steeples
* Wordpress sandbox site with bootstrap and page builder

Ideas that apply specifically to this site:

* Jekyll-based personal programming knowledgebase (big, needs some planning)
* Automate updates to the static site from this repo

And here are some I've already done that I'll try an
d get around to posting about here.

* A very lightweight persistence library for Java 
* Time sheet processor
* Some simple Java utility classes

An AI project:
* Simulate a baby's/child's brain
* Observe environment
  * Need to create artificial environment as test harness - a computer language?
* Try to do things to the environment
  * Attempt random actions and keep those that give some result, omit those that give an error
* Learn what is possible and what "works" through trial and error
  * Need to identify some basic goals, like outputing a string, computing numbers, simple algorithms
* Observe and mimic others
  * Given a simple working program, learn from it
